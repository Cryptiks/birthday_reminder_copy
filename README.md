## Overview

Remember all those times that you can't remember your close friend's birthday or the birthday of someone important in your life. Actually, this tends to happen repeatedly and you're left with an awkward situation for a least a little why and maybe a slight feeling of guilt. That is where Birthday Reminder comes in!

Birthday Reminder is a web app that will allow users to keep track of the birthdays of all of their important friends. Users can register and login. Once they're logged in, they can add each of their friend's birthday. Every time a user revisits the website, a calendar will display all the birthdays for that month. Of course there is facebook, which displays everyone's birthday. However, since it is someone's birthday everyday, this causes people to simply ignore birthdays.

This web app will also include a game where the user is randomly shown all the birthdays and will have to input the name of the friend corresponding to that birthday. In addition, there is a mirror version of the game where all the names are shown and the user has to input the birthday of each friend.
